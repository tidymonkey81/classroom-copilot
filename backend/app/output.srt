1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,599
 So this one is just a single line of text and I guess it finishes with something.

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,032
 I don't really know what that bit is that says something.

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,336
 Okay, so we've just made a new...

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,336
 in.

5
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:21,248
 So it does just open up wherever I rest, but that's now very good.

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,783
 So we're buying one that.

7
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:23,807
 in that area.

8
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:31,807
 Okay, so now we have data local. That is what we want. This is where we want to run this, I guess.

9
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:34,816
 first we want to run it for here though

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,816
 that sound right it's all, you're just going to have to set those directories

11
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:40,192
 is definitely.
